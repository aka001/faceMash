FaceMash Code

1) I have some time to kill
2) I have an interview where the interviewer and me are in two completely different time zones, and we are struggling to find a common time
3) I have this FaceMash idea I always wanted to develop.
4) I need to refresh my web2py maybe for the interview
5) So here I go....lets see how much time it takes to develop this :: FaceMash, which lets users add their own facemashes and spread the links
6) If i Develop this TODAY !! I will host this I promise :) !!
